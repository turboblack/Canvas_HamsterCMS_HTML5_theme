# Canvas HamsterCMS HTML5 theme

layout adapted for Hamster CMS
also works on  http://web1.0hosting.net/ hosting
but you can use this template as a normal html template

https://github.com/turboblack/HamsterCMS world's smallest and very simple multi-template flatfile content management system 

To use a template, create an **canvas** folder in the **templates** folder, copy **index.html** and **script.js** there, open the admin panel on the hosting, select the page, and specify this template in the options.

This is what this template looks like

to change footer - edit footer.txt in the includes folder
to change about - edit about.txt in the includes folder


I invite you to visit the hosting that runs on this CMS

http://w10.host

works with both old and new technologies, and backward compatible

Enjoy your use.
